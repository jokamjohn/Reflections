How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?
i was able to find the bug

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?
it enables you to review previous works so that you see where you went wrong
and eventually imrove the code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
manual committing enables one to save logically
automatic saving is helpful incase your pc black out unexpectedly

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
so that you can easily track all changes at once
